        React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it
        follows a component-based architecture. The core idea behind React is to
        create reusable, modular components that encapsulate specific
        functionality and can be composed together to build complex user
        interfaces. Heres an overview of how React works and its typical working
        process:
        <div>
          <h4>Component Definition:</h4>
          <p>
            React applications are built using components. A component is a
            self-contained, reusable piece of code that defines the structure
            and behavior of a part of the user interface. Components can be
            functional or class-based. Example of a functional component:
          </p>
        </div>
      </h3>
    </div>
  );
